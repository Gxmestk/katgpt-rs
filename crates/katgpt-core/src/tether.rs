//! `tether` — closed-form outcome-fit estimator blend (Issue 675).
//!
//! Source: arXiv:2608.16739 "Le Critique: Privileged Value Functions for LLM
//! Reinforcement Learning" (the TETHER baseline), distilled at
//! `riir-train/.research/426_Le_Critique_PVF_TETHER.md`. Public-tier math
//! (forecast combination, Bates–Granger lineage); the primitive's value is
//! the **never-worse guarantee + lag/EMA contract encoded as an API shape**,
//! not new math.
//!
//! ## The defect this cures
//!
//! The stack blends two estimators in several places with a **fixed or
//! threshold rule**, never fit against realized outcomes: a fixed `alpha` in
//! `DualLeoMixer` (Bench 553: fixed α + harmful student measured −100%), a
//! fixed confidence threshold in `KvRoutingConfig::blend_factor`, and a
//! hand-pinned `W_EVO`/`W_RATE` pair in riir-clippy's selection blend. A
//! fixed weight cannot express that the two axes carry different amounts of
//! information at different points of a stream's lifecycle.
//!
//! ## The mechanism
//!
//! Blend `b(ρ) = (1−ρ)·p1 + ρ·p2`, fit ρ per window by ordinary least squares
//! against realized outcomes:
//!
//! ```text
//! A_B = R − p1            (the residual the p1-only baseline leaves)
//! Δ   = p2 − p1           (the direction the p2 endpoint moves in)
//! ρ*  = clip[0,1]( Σ A_B·Δ / Σ Δ² )
//! ```
//!
//! with the **exact in-sample guarantee** `SSE(ρ*) ≤ min(SSE(p1-only),
//! SSE(p2-only))` — unconditional, because SSE is convex in ρ and both
//! endpoints (ρ = 0, ρ = 1) are feasible points of the clipped domain.
//! [`fit_rho`] + [`sse`] make that assertable. EMA smoothing
//! `ρ_k = d·ρ_{k−1} + (1−d)·ρ̂_k` bounds how far one noisy window can move
//! the applied weight.
//!
//! ## The lag law, encoded as API shape
//!
//! Fitting ρ on a window and applying it to the SAME window makes the blend a
//! function of its own realized returns — bias by construction (the paper's
//! admissibility violation). So [`TetherBlend`] makes same-window application
//! **unrepresentable**: [`observe`](TetherBlend::observe) only ever touches
//! the accumulators, and [`rho`](TetherBlend::rho) only ever reads the value
//! published by a *closed* window. The window closes inside `observe` AFTER
//! the sample is folded in, so the new ρ is visible only to later
//! selections. There is no method that applies an open window's fit;
//! [`open_rho_hat`](TetherBlend::open_rho_hat) is telemetry only and consumed
//! by nothing on this type.
//!
//! ## Admissibility vocabulary (doc-level rule)
//!
//! Which outcome streams may lawfully feed the fit:
//!
//! - **Own-future** outcomes of the decisions the blend influences:
//!   **inadmissible** (the lag law exists for exactly this).
//! - **Independent-instance sibling** outcomes (another agent's realized
//!   return under the same estimator pair): **admissible** — not caused by
//!   this consumer's selection.
//! - **Contested shared encounters** (outcomes whose value both instances
//!   influenced): **violate** admissibility — neither side's outcome is
//!   exogenous to the other. Do not feed them to the fit.
//!
//! The Monte-Carlo fixture pair in `tests` pins the rule concretely: the mean
//! advantage is preserved under an admissible conditioning signal and
//! measurably biased under a leaking one.
//!
//! ## HAZARD 1 — Report the Floor (Issue 010 rule)
//!
//! Blending a UQ primitive WITH the conformal-naive floor does **not**
//! discharge the promotion gate — the primitive itself must beat the floor
//! unblended. Runtime blending is orthogonal to the promotion gate; a
//! floor+noise blend must not be citable as "beats the floor".
//!
//! ## HAZARD 2 — ρ\* minimizes a PREDICTION loss (measured negative on a
//! ranking consumer, Bench 042)
//!
//! riir-clippy ran the full A/B (riir-clippy `.benchmarks/042`, commit
//! `5494dbe`): the in-sample guarantee held exactly on real recorded
//! streams, ρ drift was large and reproducible, alloc 0, bit-exact
//! determinism — and the consumer's **ranking** metric got significantly
//! WORSE. ρ\* is a gain only where the consumer's metric IS prediction
//! error. A consumer whose metric is a ranking or an argmax (selection,
//! routing, retrieval order) can get a strictly better SSE and a strictly
//! worse outcome — especially when one endpoint is a *deliberately biased*
//! estimator (a conservative lower bound is a bad predictor and a good
//! ranker, so the fit correctly downweights it and incorrectly loses the
//! ranking). Fit ρ against the consumer's own metric, or ship a
//! ranking-aware objective. Known-good consumer class: value-prediction
//! baselines (riir-train `loss_grpo`, Plan 345). Known-negative consumer:
//! selection blends (Bench 042, kept as the reproducible artifact).
//!
//! ## G4 (allocation)
//!
//! Scalar accumulators only — no heap, ever, no warm-up phase to amortize.

/// Default initial mixing weight: **0.0** — no evidence yet, so do not blend.
///
/// The cold-start behaviour is therefore "p1 only until the first window
/// closes", the no-regression-by-construction choice for a fresh primitive.
