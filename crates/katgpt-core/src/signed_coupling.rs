//! # The primitive
//!
//! Each of `N` entities holds a binary stance `s_i ∈ {−1, +1}`. Ties between
//! entities are **signed and typed**: `J_ij = +1` (concordant — allies),
//! `J_ij = −1` (discordant — rivals), `J_ij = 0` (no tie, simply absent from
//! the graph). One synchronous Glauber (heat-bath) step gives the probability
//! that `i` holds `+1` next tick:
//!
//! ```text
//! h_i = β⁺·Σ_j J⁺_ij·s_j  +  β⁻·Σ_j J⁻_ij·s_j  +  β₀·Σ_j |J_ij|·s_j  +  g_i
//! P(s_i = +1) = σ(h_i)
//! ```
//!
//! with `J⁺ = max(J, 0)`, `J⁻ = min(J, 0)`, and three separate couplings:
//! `β⁺` (how hard allies pull), `β⁻` (how hard rivals push), `β₀` (how hard
//! *mere connection* pulls, regardless of tie type). `g_i` is the intrinsic
//! field — the entity's own disposition, in our stack a direction-vector
//! dot-product `w·φ_i` (personality × question), which is why nothing here
//! needs training: **the caller authors the couplings.**
//!
//! Because `J⁻_ij = −1` on a discordant tie, its contribution is `−β⁻·s_j` —
//! rivals push you *away* from their stance. Collapsing the three sums into
//! one pass over the neighbor list gives the shipped kernel:
//!
//! ```text
//! h_i = Σ_{j ∈ N(i)} w[sign(J_ij)] · s_j  +  g_i
//! w[+] = β⁺ + β₀        w[−] = β₀ − β⁻
//! ```
//!
//! — a two-entry weight table. Better still, the two channels can be summed
//! *separately* and weighted once per node, because the `|J|` channel is not
//! independent: with `P = Σ_{concordant} s_j` and `D = Σ_{discordant} s_j`, the
//! third sum is just `P + D`, so
//!
//! ```text
//! h_i = (β⁺ + β₀)·P  +  (β₀ − β⁻)·D  +  g_i
//! ```
//!
//! The shipped inner loop is therefore two conditional adds per edge — **no
//! multiply and no table load in the edge loop at all**, two multiplies per
//! *node*.
//!
//! Measured (Bench 672 G2, median pairwise ratio over 9 interleaved rounds):
//! **0.97–1.02× the naive three-accumulator form** — parity to a couple of
//! percent, at ~1.8 ns per edge from N=32 to N=1024. The first draft weighted
//! each edge through a 2-entry table *inside* the edge loop and measured
//! **1.5× slower** than the naive form; the per-node hoist is what recovered
//! it. Worth knowing before "optimizing" this loop again.
//!
//! # Order parameters (the crowd-level half)
//!
//! - [`net_opinion`] `n = mean(s)` — which way the crowd leans (−1…+1).
//! - [`crowd_conviction`] `c = mean(s²)` — how *hard* it holds any stance at
//!   all, direction-blind. With pure `±1` states `c ≡ 1`; it becomes
//!   informative on the magnitude-weighted path (see below).
//! - [`SusceptibilityAccumulator`] `χ = N·Var_t(|n|)` — the response of the
//!   crowd to its own fluctuations, accumulated over ticks. Its **peak over a
//!   temperature sweep locates the critical social temperature `T_c`**, which
//!   is the paper's central diagnostic.
//!
//! The three regimes the paper names fall out of `(|n|, c)`: **indifference**
//! (both low), **polarization** (`|n|` low, `c` high — two committed camps
//! cancelling), **consensus** (both high).
//!
//! # `±1` states vs magnitude-weighted states
//!
//! The kernel reads `states` as plain `f32`, so callers have two options:
//!
//! - **Discrete** `s_j ∈ {−1, +1}` — the paper's form. Sample each tick with
//!   [`sample_states_into`]. `crowd_conviction` is then identically 1.0 and
//!   only `n` moves.
//! - **Magnitude-weighted** `s_j ∈ [−1, +1]` — a stance *held with strength*
//!   (e.g. `2·σ(x) − 1` of an emotion projection, or a running mean of recent
//!   samples). Then `c = mean(s²)` genuinely separates polarization (two
//!   committed camps, `c → 1`) from indifference (everyone wavering, `c → 0`),
//!   which is what makes the regime split legible at a single tick instead of
//!   only over a trajectory. This is the recommended consumer path.
//!
//! Both are the same code; nothing in the kernel assumes `|s| = 1`.
//!
//! # Latent vs raw boundary (per `AGENTS.md` §"Latent vs Raw Space Rules")
//!
//! Everything here is **semantic/think-brain**: stances, couplings, and the
//! local fields `h_i` are computed locally and never synced. Only crowd
//! *summaries* (`n`, `c`, `χ` per zone) may cross the sync boundary, under the
//! flock-centroid precedent (a summary is not per-entity truth). If a crowd
//! decision commits through chain, the resulting **event** is a raw TxDelta;
//! the dynamics that produced it stay latent. Never sync `h_i`.
//!
//! # Honesty note (UQ)
//!
//! `σ(h_i)` is a Bernoulli parameter of a **dynamics rule**, not a calibrated
//! forecast. Any future claim about prediction *quality* (the paper reports
//! 75–86% balanced accuracy against real LLM crowds) is a UQ-bearing claim and
//! owes the conformal-naive floor per `AGENTS.md` §"Report the Floor" — the
//! primitive itself makes no such claim.
//!
//! # Vocabulary collision (load-bearing for future greps)
//!
//! "Conviction" means two different things in this stack, and both greps must
//! land here:
//!
//! | name | crate | meaning |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`crowd_conviction`] | this module | crowd **order parameter** `mean(s²)` — how hard the crowd holds stances |
//! | Sheaf-ADMM `conviction` | `katgpt-dec::sheaf_admm`, `riir-agents::multi_agent` | per-agent/per-dim **resistance** in the consensus quadratic — how hard one agent holds its ground |
//!
//! They compose rather than compete: a Sheaf conviction vector is a natural
//! source for this module's per-agent intrinsic field `g_i`.
