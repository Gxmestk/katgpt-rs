//! cp_hopfield — Top-eigenvector associative memory recall on `CP^(d-1) = SU(d)/U(d-1)`.
//!
//! Distilled from Victor Galitski, *High-Capacity Generalized Hopfield Networks*
//! (alphaXiv 2607.hopfield-networks, JQI/UMD, 2026-07-31), with the Lie-algebraic
//! linearization from Galitski, *Phys. Rev. A* **84**, 012118 (2011).
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! A neuron is a normalized `d`-dimensional complex vector `|ξ⟩` (a "qudit")
//! defined modulo a `U(1)` phase — a point on the complex projective space
//! `CP^(d-1)`. It embeds into `R^(d²-1)` as a generalized Bloch magnetization
//! `s_a = ⟨ξ|λ_a|ξ⟩`, where `{λ_a}` are the SU(d) generators (Pauli for `d=2`,
//! Gell-Mann for `d=3`, generalized Gell-Mann for `d>3`).
//!
//! Recall is **not** vector alignment. The `i`-th neuron's active energy is a
//! Rayleigh quotient over a `d×d` Hermitian *memory kernel*:
//!
//! ```text
//! E_active[s_i] = −2 ⟨s_i | K_i | s_i⟩
//! K_i = Σ_μ O_μ^(i) |ξ_i^μ⟩⟨ξ_i^μ|
//! O_μ^(i) = (2/N) Σ_{j≠i} (|⟨s_j | ξ_j^μ⟩|² − 1/d)      (Mattis overlap, excl. i)
//! ```
//!
//! so recall = align `|s_i⟩` with the **top eigenvector** of `K_i`.
//!
//! # Why capacity inverts
//!
//! Near a stored memory the kernel decomposes as `K ≈ m|1⟩⟨1| + √α · C(d) · G`
//! with `G` a GUE random matrix. The signal is a rank-1 *spike*; the crosstalk is
//! a semicircle bulk of half-width `2√α C(d)`. The top eigenvector stays pinned to
//! the spike until the spike merges with the bulk — the **Baik-Ben Arous-Péché
//! (BBP) transition**. `C(d)` decays as `1/d²`, so the bulk shrinks and capacity
//! *grows* with `d`, where sphere-based vector alignment is gapless and decays:
//!
//! | Manifold | `α_c` (asymptotic in `N`) | Mechanism |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `S^(n-1)` | `4/(27n)` | vector alignment (gapless) |
//! | `CP^1 = S^2` (`d=2`) | 0.05 | top-eigenvector ≡ vector alignment |
//! | `CP^2` (`d=3`, qutrit) | 0.62 | top-eigenvector (BBP-gapped) |
//! | `CP^3` (`d=4`) | 2.41 | top-eigenvector |
//! | `CP^7` (`d=8`) | ~40 | top-eigenvector |
//!
//! **These numbers are asymptotic in `N`.** See [`capacity`] for the measured
//! finite-`N` values at the `N` this codebase actually uses (8, 64); the honest
//! finite-`N` correction is large and is the reason this primitive ships opt-in.
//!
//! # Modelless contract
//!
//! Everything here is deterministic construction plus numerical linear algebra:
//! the SU(d) basis and its structure constants are built in closed form, the
//! kernel is a Hebbian outer-product sum, and recall is Rayleigh-quotient ascent
//! (power iteration). **No gradient descent, no training, no learned parameters.**
//! This is what lets the primitive be loaded from a frozen snapshot (freeze/thaw
//! Path 1) rather than trained — the "stable fixed points" come from the geometry,
//! not from tuned recurrent weights.
//!
//! # Two recall paths
//!
//! - [`CpHopfieldRecaller::recall_step`] — the discrete asynchronous rule: build
//!   `K_i`, take its top eigenvector, project back to Bloch coordinates.
//! - [`llg`] — the continuous dissipative flow (generalized Landau-Lifshitz-
//!   Gilbert). Precession conserves energy; Gilbert damping lowers it monotonically
//!   (`Ė = −λ Σ |s_i ×_f B_i|² ≤ 0`). Recall = flow to a fixed point.
//!
//! # Const generics
//!
//! `D` is the complex dimension `d`; `D2` is the real Bloch dimension `d²−1`.
//! Stable Rust cannot express `[f32; D*D-1]`, so `D2` is a second const
//! parameter checked against `D` at construction. Use the [`CpHopfield2`],
//! [`CpHopfield3`], [`CpHopfield4`], [`CpHopfield8`] aliases rather than spelling
//! the pair out.
//!
//! # Scope — what this module deliberately omits
//!
//! The source paper's quantum extension (§VI–VII) is a *negative* result: it
//! concludes Hebbian data is "completely lost in random matrix spectra" in the
//! quantized model. The operative mechanism is the classical flow, so only that
//! is distilled here. The paper's RGB→qutrit image encoder (§IV) is likewise
//! application-specific; the recall mechanism is encoder-agnostic.
//!
//! See `.research/466_CPd_minus_1_Hopfield_Top_Eigenvector_Recall.md` and
//! `.plans/567_cp_hopfield_top_eigenvector_recall.md`.
