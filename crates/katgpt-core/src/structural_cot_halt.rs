//! Structural CoT halting — answer-space cycle detection on reasoning traces
//! (Issue 699 T1–T3; Research 525; arXiv:2510.07880 "TRACE").
//!
//! Distilled from TRACE (Google DeepMind/UMich): structural analysis of LLM
//! overthinking + two ground-truth-free real-time halting heuristics. This is
//! a NEW signal class beside the numeric halters (entropy, residual,
//! gain/cost, patience-on-score): halting on the trace's own **answer-space
//! structure**, which works black-box — no logits, no hidden states, no LLM
//! rater, no training. Modelless by construction (fixed arrays + BLAKE3
//! hashing + plain comparisons; zero RNG, zero softmax, zero new deps).
//!
//! # Mechanism
//!
//! [`StructuralTraceMonitor`] consumes a stream of answer-bearing reasoning
//! steps (one normalized answer per step) and classifies each step's
//! answer-space transition (the truth table is documented on
//! [`StructuralTransition`] and pinned by tests):
//!
//! - `Verify` — the answer is unchanged (the model is re-deriving / verifying
//!   the same answer).
//! - `Correct` — the answer changed to something never seen (or ring-evicted);
//!   the previous answer is marked abandoned.
//! - `BacktrackRevisit` — the answer changed BACK to a previously-abandoned
//!   answer still in the ring → an answer-space cycle (the model is going in
//!   circles, not making progress).
//!
//! Two halting policies consume those events ([`SelfLoopHalt`], the paper's
//! K-consecutive-verifications rule with paper default K=2;
//! [`BacktrackRevisitHalt`], halt on the first revisit-on-backtrack), plus
//! [`HaltPolicy::Auto`] — the pattern-conditional fusion (T3): the monitor
//! classifies the trace prefix as [`Pattern::Explorer`] or
//! [`Pattern::LateLanding`] from the answer histogram's collision purity
//! (the shipped `crate::ict::math::collision_purity`, Plan 294 — NOT
//! reimplemented here) + the positional mass of answer changes, then selects
//! the policy the paper hand-tuned per model family — derived here
//! deterministically (see [`StructuralTraceMonitor::classify_prefix`]).
//!
//! The decisions compose as a THIRD independent halt-vote family beside the
//! hidden-state residual (FPRM, Plan 266) and gain/cost (Plans 282/304) via
//! [`compose_votes`] / [`vote_from_numeric`] — mirroring the
//! `GainCostLoopHalter::halt_decision` arbiter ergonomics so a consumer can
//! run both families and merge.
//!
//! # Transition predicate (truth table, pinned by `transition_truth_table`)
//!
//! State: `current` = the previous step's normalized answer identity (`None`
//! before the first step). The answer ring stores one entry per distinct
//! answer with an `abandoned` flag (set when the answer is LEFT, cleared when
//! it becomes current again) and an activation step.
//!
//! | current | new answer | in ring? | abandoned since activation? | transition |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | None | A | – | – | `Correct` (establishment; NOT a positional change) |
//! | A | A | – | – | `Verify` (`verify_run += 1`) |
//! | A | B ∉ ring | no | – | `Correct` (push ring; A marked abandoned; a positional change) |
//! | A | B ∈ ring | yes | yes | `BacktrackRevisit` — answer-space cycle |
//! | A | B ∈ ring | yes | no | `Correct` (defensive re-activation; structurally unreachable — a non-current entry was necessarily left at least once) |
//!
//! The "abandoned since activation" flag IS the issue text's "≥1 abandonment
//! has occurred since that entry was pushed": entries are re-activated (flag
//! cleared, activation step refreshed) on revisit, so a second A→B→A cycle
//! re-arms the flag and fires the policy again (pinned by
//! `revisit_refires_after_re_abandonment`).
//!
//! # Ring wraparound (bounded-memory semantics)
//!
//! The ring holds [`RING_CAPACITY`] = 8 distinct answers; inserting a 9th
//! evicts the OLDEST slot (circular write pointer). An evicted answer later
//! re-proposed classifies `Correct` (fresh) — a cycle longer than 8 distinct
//! answers is not detected. That is the documented bound; the paper's cycles
//! are short (2–3 answers). Hash collisions (64-bit BLAKE3 truncation) would
//! conflate two answers as one — negligible at ring scale.
//!
//! # Episode semantics
//!
//! One monitor = one trace episode. The FIRST `Halt` is recorded and every
//! subsequent `step` returns that same decision without consuming state (a
//! halt ends the measurement episode — same shape as the numeric arbiter's
//! episode discipline). [`StructuralTraceMonitor::reset`] starts a fresh
//! episode with the same policy.
//!
//! # Latent vs Raw
//!
//! The halt decision (`reason: u8`, `step: usize`) is a deterministic raw
//! scalar — safe to sync/replay. The answer ring/hash state is LOCAL
//! trace-derived text identity: never synced raw; only the scalar decision
//! crosses any boundary.
//!
//! # Zero-alloc contract
//!
//! `step` / `step_key` / `classify_prefix` allocate nothing: normalization
//! streams over `&str` bytes into a stack BLAKE3 hasher (the answer String is
//! never materialized), and every table is a fixed `[…; 8]` array. Pinned by
//! the integration target's G4 audit (10k+ steps, counting allocator).
