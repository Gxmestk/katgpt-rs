//! Prover-selection statistics + cross-state advantage centering
//! (katgpt-rs Issue 692, from Research 509 — arXiv:2410.08146 Setlur et al.).
//!
//! The paper's result: per-step supervision should be **advantages under a
//! complementary prover policy**, and the right way to *select* a
//! prover/critic/verifier is not strength but distinguishability +
//! alignment (Theorem 3.1: improvement ≳ γ·(D + Al)). This module hosts the
//! modelless kernels; T1 ships the D/Al selection statistics + the theorem
//! bound + its sigmoid-gated exposure, T2 the changepoint kernel, T3 the
//! K\* interior-optimum law ([`k_star`] + [`bok_advantage`]) — the closed
//! form that replaces the empirical best-of-K sweep.
//!
//! T1 — [`distinguishability`] / [`alignment`] / [`theorem_bound`] /
//! [`selection_gate`]: offline-computable from logged Bernoulli outcomes,
//! they form a **predicted-gain pre-gate** — skip wiring a prover when the
//! bound says ≈0 gain, before any runtime cost. The paper's selector
//! inverts our strength-only rankings everywhere (drafters by mean
//! acceptance, rules by Elo, critics by head quality): a *weaker but
//! complementary* prover beats a stronger one (Prop F.1: complementarity η
//! ⇒ Ω(η²) gain — this is NOT distillation; the prover's ceiling does not
//! bound the gain).
//!
//! T2 — `first_pit`: the first index where a Q̂ sequence pits (drops below
//! ε). Consumer: riir-clippy's PAV data curation (riir-train Plan 356 A1)
//! segments incorrect edit sequences at their first pit — the prefix before
//! it is the (prefix, Q̂) training pair's boundary. riir-clippy's
//! `pav_data::first_pit` is a twin of this fn (identical signature +
//! semantics); the twin swaps to this import when its crate bumps the
//! katgpt-core dep.
//!
//! Pure modelless arithmetic, no deps, no allocs, zero-cost-unless-invoked.

/// Distinguishability D(μ) = E_s Var_{a~π}[A^μ(s,a)] — how much the prover's
/// **advantage** varies across the base policy's actions, averaged over
/// states (Theorem 3.1's first term).
///
/// A prover that succeeds from any prefix (too strong) or fails from any
/// prefix (too weak) has Q^μ flat within every state ⇒ A^μ ≡ 0 ⇒ D = 0 —
/// the paper's core prediction, pinned by tests here. Selection by D alone
/// already inverts strength ranking: the *intermediate* prover wins.
///
/// # Estimator
///
/// Both logs are ragged 2-D: `base_outcomes[s][a]` = Q̂^π(s,a) and
/// `prover_outcomes[s][a]` = Q̂^μ(s,a), the Bernoulli success means logged at
/// the (state, action) pairs the base policy visited. The empirical action
/// distribution **is** the π-weight: uniform over a state's logged entries,
/// with entry multiplicity encoding π(a|s) (duplicate an entry to weight
/// it). V^μ(s) = mean_a Q^μ(s,a) and A^μ(s,a) = Q^μ(s,a) − V^μ(s); because
/// the advantages are exactly centered under those weights,
/// Var_{a~π}[A^μ] = mean_a (A^μ)². `base_outcomes` defines the support the
/// prover must be evaluated on (shape contract, `debug_assert`ed; states
/// with no logged entries are skipped; an empty log yields 0.0).
///
/// Non-negative by construction (mean of squares), ≤ 0.25 for Q̂ ∈ [0,1]
/// (Popoviciu). NaN entries propagate — screening is the caller's contract
/// (the same totality stance as [`first_pit`]).
