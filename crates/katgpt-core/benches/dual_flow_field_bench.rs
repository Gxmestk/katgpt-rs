//! Plan 459 — FlowField × DualLeoMixer fusion GOAT gate.
//!
//! Proves the modelless fusion (LEO teacher + UVFA student mixed via DualLeoMixer
//! at α=0.3 Lc) produces a measurably better navigation field than the LEO-only
//! baseline that FlowFieldCache::get_or_compute currently ships.
//!
//! Run:
//!   cargo run --release --bench dual_flow_field_bench \
//!     --features flow_field_nav,dual_leo
//!
//! Gates:
//!   G1 (correctness): LeoOnly dual path ≡ get_or_compute single path (bit-identical)
//!   G2 (perf overhead): dual/LeoOnly cache-miss latency ratio ≤ 1.5×
//!   G3 (no-regression): all gates report PASS, no panic
//!   G4 (alloc-free hot path): combine_into writes into pre-allocated buffer
//!                              (informational — code inspection confirms)
//!   G5 (quality gain): Lc(α=0.3) avg path length < LeoOnly by ≥10%,
//!                       OR local-minima stuck count reduced ≥30%.
